# Recycli - AI-Powered Recycling App

Recycli is an innovative Android application developed during the ACM-W National Hackathon, where it was awarded runner-up. The app leverages artificial intelligence to assist users in identifying and classifying materials for recycling.

## About Recycli

The Recycli app uses machine learning to analyze images of items and classifies them into one of ten material categories such as metal, wood, paper, etc. It features an "Ecometer" that evaluates how eco-friendly a product is based on its material and other environmental factors. This tool aims to promote recycling and educate users on sustainable practices.

## Features

- **Material Classification**: Utilizes a trained ML model to classify items into categories like metal, wood, and paper.
- **Ecometer**: Calculates and displays an eco-friendliness score for each item, helping users understand the environmental impact of products.
- **Photo Capture**: Allows users to take pictures directly through the app for instant material classification.

## Technologies Used

- **Android**: The app is designed for Android devices.
- **Machine Learning**: Incorporates a pre-trained model to classify materials based on images.
- **AI Frameworks**: Uses TensorFlow or a similar framework to manage and run the machine learning model.
